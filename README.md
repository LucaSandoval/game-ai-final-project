# TAGGERS! - Autonomous Models for Player Perception and Pathfinding

## CS5150 Final Project

### Overview

Agent pathfinding and perception have long been topics of interest for artificial intelligence research, especially for their use in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and video games; age-old pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A-Star are still commonly used for exploring the surroundings of an environment, while perception systems can vary wildly based on an AI’s specific intent and purpose. 

As such, we present TAGGERS!, a tag simulator that demonstrates our knowledge of the inner workings of AI pathfinding and perception agents. Using 4 different behavior models, we showcase the Game AI topics of movement and perception through the medium of a single-player 2D reflex game. TAGGERS! is fully-playable with player controls, menu screens, and a win/loss condition; we extend what we’ve learned in CS5150 to improve our tagging systems with predictive movement, information searching, and advanced group behavior.
